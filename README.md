# Rock_Paper_Scissor-Game
I have made Rock Paper Scissor game to boost my java script skills. 
It has three buttons which can be clicked by the person and the computer will generate a number randomly and will match it with the list.
Based on that if both are same then will display "DRAW", and simillarly display "YOU LOOSE" and "YOU WIN".
